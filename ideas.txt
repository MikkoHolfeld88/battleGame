To 1: you start as a mini cell and crawl around in a wobbly slimy zone where planktons and small other microcells
fly by that you can coincidentally hit, this might crush you hurt you or let you grow, with certain amounts of hits
you grwo bigger and more sophisticaed and get into ither zones, over this involvment process you can add features to
your creatures like sense, legs, arms, spikes and so on, this phase has a lot of sub phases that are not to be defined
100% for now. But it should also make sure that in this phase you meet other online players who could eat or crush
you and cobine with you. Its a mixture of spore and agar.io and minecreft regarding resource management. As you
grow, the world around you grows as well in different phases, so that the way you gather changes and your
resource management gets more complex, 2: its basically the window after you finished a phase or gather so
much resources that you can update your creature, in a later phase you can always hit this window and modify or
enlagre your creature. 3: the same resources you use on youre creature can later be used on weaopons as well,
similar to little Alchemy mobile game but more adavaned in graphics, stat management and with a world of warcraft
 feel to it, thnking about how you balance your creature stats and your weapon stats. 4: this is kind of a new feature
 where you and your personal device and creature have to combine, so there is a physics engine that allows for
 certain moves you can programm. YOu have a set ot allowed points for gravity crushing, air resistnace, movenemt
 points, sterngth and so on (created by your gathering) and then you can use those to say when i press this
  button my left third arm can move with a speed of this , beacuse its mass is this and the air resistance
  is this and so on, you basically set up your character and your attacks or defense mechanisms by your sef,
   what usually a game engineer does when he sets up a character for a video game. 5: Training i havent
   thought out yet but it is an offline mode where you can test your skills on certain bot levels, 6 the main
    game is like brawlhalla or tekken with match making in differnt mdes 1:1, 2:2, tournament and so on and
    you can fight other creatures. The Whole Idea of the game is comparable to thosse real life robot fights,
     but here in a way with more possibilites.
