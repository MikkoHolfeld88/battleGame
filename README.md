# Battle Game Project (Placeholder Name)

This project is the foundational TypeScript codebase for an online 2D battle game. It includes the initial setup for core game logic, data structures, and service placeholders.

## Project Structure

-   `src/`: Contains all the TypeScript source code.
    -   `core/`: Core functionalities like authentication, input handling, and base types.
        -   `types.ts`: Core data structures (Player, GameObject, Resource).
        -   `auth.service.ts`: Placeholder for player registration and login.
        -   `input.service.ts`: Placeholder for handling player input.
    -   `game/`: Game-specific logic and types.
        -   `types.ts`: Game-related data structures (Match, Creature, BodyPart, Weapon, Ability, etc.).
        -   `battle.service.ts`: Placeholder for real-time battle logic.
        -   `crafting.service.ts`: Placeholder for crafting mechanics (body parts, weapons).
        -   `gathering.service.ts`: Placeholder for the resource gathering phase.
    -   `network/`: Network-related services.
        -   `matchmaking.service.ts`: Placeholder for finding opponents.
    -   `ui/`: (Currently empty) Intended for UI components and logic in the future.
    -   `index.ts`: Main entry point for the application, demonstrating a simulated game flow.
-   `dist/`: Contains the compiled JavaScript output (after running `npm run build`).
-   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
-   `package.json`: Manages project dependencies and scripts.
-   `tsconfig.json`: Configuration file for the TypeScript compiler.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Build the Project:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command compiles the TypeScript code from `src/` into JavaScript in the `dist/` directory.

3.  **Run the Simulation:**
    ```bash
    node dist/index.js
    ```
    This will execute the example simulation defined in `src/index.ts`, printing output to the console.

## Development Goals

The aim is to build a game with the following features:
1.  Player registration.
2.  ELO-based matchmaking.
3.  Real-time battle mode with keyboard controls, hit zones, damage, etc.
4.  A pre-battle gathering phase for resource collection.
5.  Crafting system for body parts, weapons, and abilities using gathered resources.
6.  Input configuration system to map device actions to game movements.

This codebase provides the initial scaffolding for these features.
