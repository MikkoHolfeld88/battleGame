  "landingPage.phases.phase1.description": "Start as a humble cell in a vibrant, wobbly world teeming with life and danger. Consume plankton and microcells to grow, but beware – other players might see you as a snack or a threat! Every interaction can lead to growth, injury, or even absorption. As you evolve, so does the world, presenting new challenges and more complex resource management. It's a unique blend of Spore's evolution, Agar.io's survival, and Minecraft's resourcefulness.",

Every weapon choice impacts your combat style.",

  "landingPage.phases.phase4.description": "This is where you become the game engineer. Define your creature's every move. Utilizing a sophisticated physics engine, you'll allocate points (earned through gathering) to parameters like gravity influence, air resistance, movement speed, and strength. Then, map these to your device's inputs. Program the exact arc of a swing, the force of a pounce, or the intricacies of a defensive stance. Your creativity in programming directly translates to your creature's effectiveness.",
